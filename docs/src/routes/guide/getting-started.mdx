# Getting Started

SolidBase wraps your SolidStart config rather than wrapping SolidStart itself,
so you can add SolidBase to most existing Start projects or create a new one.

## Creating a New Project

Follow Start's [getting started guide](https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-start/getting-started)
to create a new project.
We'd recommend using the `basic` preset as it includes `@solidjs/router`,
and recommend against the `with-mdx` preset as SolidBase will provide MDX spport for you.

## Adding SolidBase to Your Project

Install `@kobalte/solidbase` using your preferred package manager.

In your project's `app.config`, wrap the config being passed to `defineConfig` with `withSolidBase`.
This will configure SolidBase with the default theme.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";
import { withSolidBase } from "@kobalte/solidbase/config";

export default defineConfig(withSolidBase(/* your SolidStart config */));
```

Lastly, add the `SolidBaseRoot` component to the `root` of your project's `Router`.

```tsx
<!-- app.config.ts -->
import { SolidBaseRoot } from "@kobalte/solidbase/client";
import { Router } from "@solidjs/router";
import { FileRoutes } from "@solidjs/start/router";

export default function App() {
	return (
		<Router root={SolidBaseRoot}>
			<FileRoutes />
		</Router>
	);
}
```

If your router already has a `root` component, you can wrap it with `SolidBaseRoot`.

```tsx
<Router
  root={(props) => {
    return <SolidBaseRoot>{props.children}</SolidBaseRoot>;
  }}
>
  <FileRoutes />
</Router>
```

Your project is now setup with the default SolidBase theme!
