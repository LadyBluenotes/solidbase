# Markdown Extensions

SolidBase comes with many markdown extensions from [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/) to fully custom ones.
All of their options and usage examples are listed here.

## Autolinked Titles

All titles will have an associated unique slug and self link.

```md
# My Docs

## Subheading
```

will generate:

```html
<h1 id="my-docs"><a href="#my-docs">My Docs</a></h1>

<h2 id="subheading"><a href="#subheading">Subheading</a></h2>
```

## External Links

Outbound links automatically get `target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"`:

- [start.solidjs.com](https://start.solidjs.com)
- [SolidBase on GitHub](https://github.com/kobaltedev/solidbase)

## Frontmatter

[YAML frontmatter](https://mdxjs.com/guides/frontmatter/) is supported out of the box:

```yaml
---
title: SolidBase
layout: home
---
```

This data will be available to the rest of the page, along with all custom and theming components.

For more details, see [Frontmatter](../reference/frontmatter).

## GitHub-flavored Alerts

SolidBase also supports [GitHub-flavored alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts) to render as callouts. They will be rendered the same as the [custom containers](#custom-containers).

```md
> [!NOTE]
> Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.

> [!TIP]
> Optional information to help a user be more successful.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

> [!WARNING]
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.

> [!CAUTION]
> Negative potential consequences of an action.
```

## Syntax Highlighting in Code Blocks

SolidBase uses [Expressive Code](https://expressive-code.com/) to highlight language syntax in Markdown code blocks, using coloured text. Expressive Code supports a wide variety of programming languages and additional features. All you need to do is append a valid language alias to the beginning backticks for the code block:

**Input**

````
```tsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <Counter/>
  );
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "values": 4
  }
}
```
````

**Output**

```tsx
export default function App() {
  return <Counter />;
}
```

<br/>
```json
{
  "data": {
    "values": 4
  }
}
```

A [list of valid languages](https://github.com/antfu/textmate-grammars-themes/blob/main/packages/tm-grammars/README.md) is available on GitHub.

## Line Highlighting in Code Blocks

TODO: broken

**Input**

````
```ts{4}
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: 'Highlighted!'
    }
  }
}
```
````

**Output**

```ts{4}
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: 'Highlighted!'
    }
  }
}
```

In addition to a single line, you can also specify multiple single lines, ranges, or both:

- Line ranges: for example `{5-8}`, `{3-10}`, `{10-17}`
- Multiple single lines: for example `{4, 7, 9}`
- Line ranges and single lines: for example `{4, 7-13, 16, 23-27, 40}`

**Input**

````
```js{1, 4, 6-8}
export default { // Highlighted
  data () {
    return {
      msg: `Highlighted!
      This line isn't highlighted,
      but this and the next 2 are.`,
      motd: 'VitePress is awesome',
      lorem: 'ipsum'
    }
  }
}
```
````

**Output**

```js{1, 4, 6-8}
export default { // Highlighted
  data () {
    return {
      msg: `Highlighted!
      This line isn't highlighted,
      but this and the next 2 are.`,
      motd: 'VitePress is awesome',
      lorem: 'ipsum',
    }
  }
}
```

## Line Numbers

TODO: broken

You can enable line numbers for each code block by adding `showLineNumbers` after the language.

**Input**

````md
```ts
// line-numbers is disabled by default
const line2 = "This is line 2";
const line3 = "This is line 3";
```

```ts showLineNumbers
// line-numbers is enabled
const line2 = "This is line 2";
const line3 = "This is line 3";
```
````

**Output**

```ts
// line-numbers is disabled by default
const line2 = "This is line 2";
const line3 = "This is line 3";
```

<br />
```ts showLineNumbers // line-numbers is enabled const line2 = 'This is line 2' const
line3 = 'This is line 3' ```
