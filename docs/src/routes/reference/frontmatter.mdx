# Frontmatter Config

TODO

Most of these are specific to the default theme and will be moved eventually.

## Title

The page title is assigned from the `title` value:

```md
---
title: Tab Title
---

# Page Title
```

The title is formatted from the config:

```ts
<!-- app.config.ts -->
/* SolidBase options */
{
	titleTemplate: ":title â€“ SolidBase",
}
```

## Layout

More options such as `layout` are available in the [Default Theme](./default-theme) reference.
